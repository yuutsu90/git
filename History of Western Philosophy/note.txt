Two Principles of Philosophy
1. reasoning
2. charity(necessity) - maximum sense of the words and thoughts of others that tells others which optimizes agreements.
 -true statements
 -words in the ordinary way
 -valid arguments
 -something interesting

1. Ending life of person = murder
2. ending life of a fetus is not same as killing person
3. abortion is murder?
4. abortion isn't murder

enthymeme = an argument in which one premise is not explicitly stated.

Thales = first philosopher (father of the philosophy)
 -Inscribed a right triangle of a circle
 -Measured the height of a pyramid
 -Fixed the length of the year
 -Identified the use of constellation for navigation
 -predicted the solar eclipse 585 BC

Cosmology
 -Said the earth rests on water
 -Everything is made out of water

valid vs sound arugment

philosopher >> what and how

onto = being
ontology = study of what is real

arche = origin
archeology = study of ancient or first things

Thale thought that there is one fundamental thing that makes up everything else

Anaximander = student of Thales (arche = infinite) 
 -ultimate reality is unknowable because it is "non-sensory"

Anaximenes = student of Anaximander
 -basic elemet was air

Xenophanes
 -baisc element was Earth
 -God is beyond human comprehension
 -First philosopher of religion
 -Monotheism (god is one) vs. Polytheism
 -God is neither infinite nor finite, neither changeable nor changeless
 -we can't imagine because we are human being
 -God is beyond our limit 


Heraclitus
 -everything was "Fire"
 -but there is also no Arche
 -didn't believe that "everything" is made out of Fire or other element

Stephen Hawking = started the theory of universe

Heraciltus: Change
 -no arguments
 -just quotes
 -only constant is change
 -way up and way down are same
 -everything is conflict
 -obviously true things are talked
 -no fundamental element
 -there is only no basic Arche
 -metaphorically used fire to describe that everything is changing

"Logos" = law which governs all things
 -Logos is constant but it seems to be some kind of force or principle, not substance. 

gravitiy, electromagnetism, weak interaction, strong interaction


Parmenides: Being
 -lived in Elea in Italy (~515-440)
 -Philosopher of Being [Onto] ex. ontology
 -Anselm (God is everything)
 -The Way of Truth / Appearance (doxa)
 -"Nothing can come from nothing."
 -"Thought and Being are the same"
 -nothing is something that we can not think about

Arugment for Being (Monism)
 -Being is
 -Unbeing is
 -Both Being and Unbeing are

Consequences
 -being must have no beginning, no end; it is inifinite
 -being must be one and undivied; no multiplicity

Change is illusory.

Presentism = anachronistic introduction of present-day ideas and perspectives into depictions or interpretations of the past

Eternalism = referred to as Parmenidean, nothing ever disappears; we have always been.

Karl Popper = falsifying ability

Law of Conservation of Energy = undergo change of form


Empedocle
 -four elements are "Roots"
 - "Arche is many"
 - controlled by Love and Strife

Democritus: Atomism
 -'atoms' (indivisible), infinite in number and kind and empty space
 -"Archy is many"

Aristotle: earth, water, air, fire + ether (quintessence)

Atomism: until 20th c. discovered 118 chemical elements [periodic table]

"Sophism": To argue in a persuaive but ultimately fallacious way or to be deceitful

"Sophistry": Subtly deceptive reasoning.

Sophist: peripatetic teachers who taught for a fee

Rhetoric: make weak argument to be more strong

Plato: Sophists are a bad influence on the young, for they encourage skepticism, relativism, cynicism


Protagoras: Man
 -most famous of the Sophists (~490-420 BC), and agnostic
 
"Man is the measure of all things, both of things that are that they are, and of things that are not that they are not."

Humanist : "human beings" central
 -Relativism
